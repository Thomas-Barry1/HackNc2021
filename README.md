# HackNc2021: Climate Game

## Description
The concept for the game was to create a city-building game with a heavy emphasis on building a sustainable future. It was meant to track environmental damage in addition to the settlement's economic well-being, and though it would reward initial investments in nonrenewables, players would eventually realize that if they do not transition their settlement will face decline.


## Using the Project
Some key components of the project are still complete, but to use it as-is the project could be run in the Unity editor. Scene 2 is the up-to-date scene which holds the main map.
